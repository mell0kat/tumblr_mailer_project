  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>

  <p>
    How's it going? It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
    since we last talked. As you know, I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy, and it's been a blast and a half! This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
    Look at my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Talk soon,<br>
